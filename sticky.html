            <h3><u><i>Mango :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica.
                It originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.
                indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: 
                the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes",
                the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.</b>

            <h3><u><i>Banana :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit botanically a berry produced by several kinds of large treelike
                    herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, 
                    distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually 
                    elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have a variety of colors when
                    ripe. It grows upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) cultivated 
                    bananas come from two wild species Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, or hybrids of them.</b>

            <h3><u><i>Guava :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>Guava is a common tropical fruit cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions.The common guava
                    Psidium guajava (lemon guava, apple guava) is a small tree in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), native to
                    Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America.The name guava is also given to some
                    other species in the genus Psidium such as strawberry guava (Psidium cattleyanum) and to the pineapple
                    guava, Feijoa sellowiana. In 2019, 55 million tonnes of guavas were produced worldwide, led by India with
                    45% of the total. Botanically, guavas are berries.</b>

            <h3><u><i>Watermelon :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit.
                    A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.
                    Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large edible fruit, which
                    is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually
                    deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the 
                    rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.</b>

            <h3><u><i>cherry :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).Commercial cherries are obtained from
                    cultivars of several species,such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry
                    tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental
                    cherry" or "cherry blossom." Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is
                    often referred to specifically by the name "wild cherry" in the British Isles.</b>

            <h3><u><i>Orange :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>The taste of oranges is determined mainly by the ratio of sugars to acids, whereas orange aroma derives from volatile organic compounds,
                    including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes, and esters.[36][37] Bitter limonoid compounds, such as limonin, decrease gradually during
                    development, whereas volatile aroma compounds tend to peak in mid- to late-season development.[38] Taste quality tends to improve later in harvests
                    when there is a higher sugar/acid ratio with less bitterness.[38] As a citrus fruit, the orange is acidic, with pH levels ranging from Taste and aroma
                    vary according to genetic background, environmental conditions during development, ripeness at harvest, postharvest conditions, and storage duration.</b>

            <h3><u><i>Coconut :-</i></u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>The coconut tree provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses. The inner flesh of the mature
                    seed, as well as the coconut milk extracted from it, forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts
                    are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of an almost clear liquid, called "coconut water" or "coconut juice".
                    Mature, ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds, or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the
                    fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra, and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking frying in particular as well as in soaps
                    and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar. The hard shells, fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves
                    can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decoration.</b>
